# ShowtimeApp

An Android application for "following" TV shows schedules. You search for shows, follow them and the app sets notifications on your phone. The TV show schedules are looked up through [TheTVDB.com](https://www.thetvdb.com/), a freely-available up-to-date database of TV show schedules.
